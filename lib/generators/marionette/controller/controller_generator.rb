				## TODO: IF YOU HAVE NOT ADDED ANY ACTIONS, IT SHOULD ASK YOU A SERIES OF QUESTIONS TO DECIDE WHAT YOU WANT TO BUILD
				## IE: DO YOU WANT DIALOGS? ARE YOU EDITING ANYTHING? ARE YOU SHOWING ANYTHING? ARE YOU LISTING ANYTHING?
				## LOOK AT MY WEBAPP MODULES AND FIND PATTERNS, IF THERE AREN'T PATTERNS, CREATE THEM!
				## rails g marionette:module users show list edit -> listUsers showUser editUser <- methods -- actually just use |list, show, edit, new/New|
				## or just ask questions to determine stuff if there aren't any actions... that's probably better
			
			## TODO: ASK WHAT SUB MODULES YOU'D LIKE ADDED AS WELL - WHICH COME AFTER THE MODULE - LIKE SCAFFOLDS
